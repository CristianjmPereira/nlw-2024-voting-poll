# NWL Expert Node.js Voting Poll Project

This project is part of the NWL Expert Node.js course. It's a voting poll application that uses a variety of technologies to provide a real-time, interactive voting system.

## Technologies Used

- Docker: Used for creating isolated environments to run the application.
- Node.js: The main runtime environment for the server-side logic.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, used to write safer and more understandable code.
- Redis: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
- WebSockets: A communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection, used for real-time updates.
- Fastify: A web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.
- Prisma: A modern database ORM toolkit used to access databases in Node.js and TypeScript.
